## What Blockchain could do

### Signing document

Problem in public sectors: signing document.
There is still a lot of study on how to digitalize document and digitalize signing

Blockchain can change the realtion between citizen and the polititian

**danger**: Pure digitalization --> create e-buraucracy

*Crime cartels are the only organisation that organise successfully accross the world*

Actions: Stop bureaucracy, start thinking... about solution

**Blockchain** can deal with all bureaucracy issue.

### Why using Blockchain

* Register transaction in a irrefutable way
	* Big task done by the gov
	* Copying signature is easy
	* Transforming blockchain is complex
	* less hackable
	* distributed system
	* give authenticity (via hashing) to transaction and docs

By using the system of **Smart Contract** **Blockchain** can simplify the procedure linked to handing allowances according to decided politcal rules

With **BLockchain** you can reduce the need of 3rd party, if the initial condition are present, no need for a third party, no need for administration

### Use-cases

Most of them come from Nederlands

* Waste transport
* Taxation impact
* Self sovereign id
* Shared property & decentralized mrkt place
* Autonomous object in public space (parking tickets...)

One use case from flemish gov.

One use case from Antwerp: POC Lifecycle

#### POC LifeCycle

with *Accenture*: **Levensloop**

*A better way to recreate the fact chain: Fact around your life*

##### 1. Creating a digital vault where you and only you can manage your data and who have access to which data for how long

1. Download the app
2. Create id
3. Choose a key system (ie ID, physician INAMI nummer...)
4. Give access to data through QR code or NFC or ... choose chich data, how long, to who
5. The physiscian use the code to request access and receive the access
6. The user validate an administration document with the signature of another user by the same way with an easy previously defined business logic
7. Services can be started to prevent administrative task linked to the contract in the future
8. Additional verification could be done via the device such as: finding nearby users or using GPS to sign a document
