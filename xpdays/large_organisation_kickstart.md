### Steps


#### Get support

Ask 5 senior manager to become the Agile Driving Team

Good thing: you can't kill the agile change because it's spread accros 5 dept.

**Hack 1**: Include influencial people (use their connections + protection)


#### Communicate and involve people

No e-mail communication, plain poster

In the poster you put all the information + registration (via QR code for instance) including the number of person subscribed (changed daily)

**Hack 2**: simple paper communication

#### Compute and analyse

Gather all the data and analyse them

**Hack 3**: Use your own analytics skills

#### Actions instead of power point

They used a video (no change possible too late), people get borred with powerpoints, a video once it's done, it's done no rollback.

**Hack 4**: Let people pay for their remarks

#### Communicate back to people

**Hack 5**: Take no action = approbation approach

#### Work in project and keep timing

Once you start people shows up and then not anymore, at that tiem the managment pull back, you have to continue

**Hack 6**: be persistent in what you do

#### Communication

Via sharepoint
Via Yammer internal and closed facebook group
Via trello to follow up on action
No e-mail

Communication channels are open by default (no question asked)
Communicate fast

**Hack 7**: Make communication transparent

### Experiments

#### Topic of the week

* 20 participants
* 12 topics
* 12 weeks

Goal: Grew our agile community and get more people inside

### Continuously do it

Create new open space and continue to improve, use the community
