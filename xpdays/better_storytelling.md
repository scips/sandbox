*The pitch*

by Victor Hezemans & Nicole Bellios

## What to avoid

* people not listening
* falling asleep

## Take 2 minutes about a story to tell

* take a story you gonna work on, something exiting you did

> Started running to remove fat, then I did a marathon ... and I wanna do more, it changed my way of thinking and working


## Target of this presentation

* Product Owner
* Scrum masters
* Dev team
* internal/external stakeholders

## How to make sure people remember message

ideally 3 equals parts:

* education: 33%
* entertainment: 33%
* empowerment: 33%

but it doesn't work

The brain is against it:
- the part that knows all the fact (outerpart)
- the part that take decision is the inner part

For iPhone you know that they are using slavery to build their phone and you still buy them

## Story

> Hiking in austria with her college friend wendy

situation, persona, climate, clothes ...
environment...

then

speak about the goal

describe the situation, what was going on

Then add the situation change and explain how it changes, speak about feeling and decision taking

New situation, new feelings

Then add a situation change

Go to the conclusion and a little moral

### Take it as a metaphore

The mountain is a metaphore, be prepared well!

## Let's go back to the presentation / and how to prepare well

Use a canvas:

### But first: "the stage is yours"

Ask someone to stand up and chare a story

### as a story teller

The 9 hollywood steps

#### get the audience listening and walk in your choose

1. set the scene
2. characters
3. journey

#### the encounter

4. obstacle
5. overcome the obstacle
6. resolve the story

#### resolving the story

I went through my story... and now what?

7. make the point
8. ask the question
9. repeat the point

Ask the audience to go back to a time, location where your point did apply

Have you ever been there? Did that? Did it make you remember something?

### Work in group

#### 10' working

Tell your story in group of 3-4 people for 10'

Check which of the 9 steps where taken into account and how?

#### Who has a good story?

Ask if someone wants to go on stage
Repeating is a good way to do it

#### Go to the 9 points one by one

* help to find more points

borrow emotion from the story to make the point

## Tips

1. Time line and intensity line
    * Move forward to make it more intensive
    * Move backward to make it less intensive
    * Move left to speak about the past
    * Move right to speak about the future
2. Use phantom object
    * The backpack
    * The bycicle
    * Make the object real
3. Change the tone of voice
    * Persona voice

Join **toast master** to practice

## How do you start: 4 connect method

1. Stimuli: Something to make them look at you, get them off they current position, thought
2. Advantage: Explain why they will have an advantage listening to you
3. Expertise: Why you instead of google or someone else
4. Story: go to your story

Ex:
* 3-4 slide with well prepared stimuli (picture)
* Benefits slides
* Show your expertise slides
* Story

### Work in group

#### Find the 4 connects with the previous story 5'
