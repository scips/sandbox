# Practices for effective meetings, proposal forming and decusion making

**Presenters** Frederik Vannieuwenhuyse, Siemen Bastiaens

## context

* 5 Agile teams
* Needed more interaction between the 5 different teams

Need:  Chapters, CoP

We had the visit of the guy behind: [Sociocracy 3.0](http://sociocracy30.org/)

## Sociocracy

Collection of practical guide influenced of lean/agile...

### Driver concept

What is your source of motivation?

**Tensions**: what are the frictions that prevent you from reaching your goal

Ex: Setting up jenkins instead is a pain in the a.. we need a fast way to set them up.

**next step**: let's approach it in an iterative step by step way
Is it *good enough for now and safe enought to try*

### Decision making

* Majority
* Consensus

In sociocracy we want to have **consent**. = Proceed if we have no reason to not to proceed.

Do you have any objections? Then let's go.
Otherwise: Share the objection, treat it as a gift and use it as an opportunity to improve.

In sociocracy **concern** does not stop the way to change

**objection**:
**concern**:

#### Way of voting

At the same time everyone gives a thumb up or down

Ex: Objections: it must not be in the cloud

Solution: remote the in the cloud concept and vote again

### Proposal forming

Structured approach:
1. Consent to drive
2. List questions
3. Consider the questions in a round table format
4. Gather info about questions
5. Time boxed creative session to spread ideas
6. Define tuners: Who would like or should be tuning this proposal
7. Tunner will design the proposal (in small group, offline, after the meeting)

Ex:
2. List questions
- what is jenkins?
- what do you mean by dev process?
3. Consider questions
- what are the constraint regarding budgeting?
- How many steps to spin up a jenkins instance?
5. Ideas
- train
- automate
- use SaaS
6. Select motivated tuners
7. Proposal

### Consent Decision Making

You have a proposal, let's have a consent

Structured approach:
1. Consent to driver
2. Present proposal
3. Clarifying Q?
4. Brief response (give a short word or phrase to summarize or know if they like it or not) \[optional?\] *facilitator*
5. Any objections? -> gift
6. Resolve objections *facilitator* Check if it's: **Safe enought and Good enought to try** then it's ok
7. Vote
8. Celebrate
9. Consider Concerns (if there is time left) + note them or share them

Ex: Objection: What if Jan goes on holiday what may happen?
- Re-appoint tuners & tune the proposal to resolve the objection, include the objecter in the solution design

## How did it help?

* More alignment
* More focus
* Step by step approach (Safe enough to try & good enough for now?)
* Give structure
* Everyone has an opportunity to say something

## Tips

* Postopone solution thining, let's keep the structured ways, ask them to note on post-it
* Do not assign, pull, not push, if no volunteer maybe you are doing to much --> Use kanban board with a wip limit on the number of drivers
* facilitator facilitate
* Keep collection questions and answering them after one by one
* Keep the same team

## Questions

* What about people that are not in the group that will object later on?
> We just move forward and create a new driver if the objection is a real problem

* How long does it take to have consent
> It needs 2 weeks to have a consent

* Does the tuner have a kind of spike to try out thing and propose solution?
> tuning phase takes up to two weeks
* % time
> 1h / week for decision
> a bit more for the tunners
* tuners could be involved in the execution of the process but it's not mandatory
