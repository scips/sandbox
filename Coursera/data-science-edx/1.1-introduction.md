# Distributions

two numbers to understand it all

* Average
* Standard Deviation

Are most of the time sufficient

Technics to understand if they are sufficient or not: ... will be seeen

# Type of data

* Categorical (sex: male or female; region: north, west, south, east)
  * ordinals (spiciness: hot, medium, mild)
  * non-ordinals
* Numerical (population size; murder rate; sizes)
  * Discrete (population count (integer) but cound be considered continue)
  * Continue (height)

from the course:

* Categorical data are variables that are defined by a small number of groups.
  * Ordinal categorical data have an inherent order to the categories (mild/medium/hot, for example).
  * Non-ordinal categorical data have no order to the categories.
* Numerical data take a variety of numeric values.
  * Continuous variables can take any value.
  * Discrete variables are limited to sets of specific values.

# Exercices

```R
library(dslabs)
data(heights) # load data
head(heights) # how data looks like
x <- heights$height # take a vector (column) and assign it to a  variable (x here)
length(unique(x)) # measure the lenght of unique values in height
```

There are 1000 values in the heights database but only 139 unique --> Discrete numerical values

Put everything in a distribution table and find out how many data are present only once

```R
library(dslabs)
data(heights) # load data
tab <- table(heights$height)
sum(tab == 1) # only the value that are counted once
```
